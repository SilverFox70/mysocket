Test of express.io web sockets

For the most part this code is a copy of what you can find over [here](https://github.com/techpines/express.io/tree/master/examples).

To run the web socket draw example, simply type:

  `$:node app`
  
  
Then open up two browsers and point them both to `localhost:3000`. Drawing will be broadcast from one window to the other.
